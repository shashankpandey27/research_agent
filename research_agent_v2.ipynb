      "A private placement refers to the offer of securities or invitation to subscribe securities to a select group of individuals by a company, excluding a public offer. This method allows a company to raise funds without going through the process of a public offer. To conduct a private placement, a company must meet certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the offer or invitation to subscribe securities must be made to a maximum of fifty persons, or a higher number as prescribed by the regulations. However, qualified institutional buyers and employees of the company offered securities under an employee stock option scheme are excluded from this limit.\n",

      "Secondly, the private placement must comply with the prescribed conditions, including the form and manner of the private placement. These conditions ensure that the private placement is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.\n",
